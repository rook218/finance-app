  <!-- 
        make a table to show all categories and compare the actual
        and ideal. This will require splitting the components and
        making a service and I'd rather deploy it first, get a job
        and add the functionality later. 
        
        Splitting the components will also solve the problem of needing
        to render the HTML template before the TS file so there are
        canvases to attach to, but needing to render the TS file before
        the HTML element so there is totals.income etc data to populate
